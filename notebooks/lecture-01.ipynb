    "\n",
    ":::{.callout-note title=\"Functions act on variables\"}\n",
    "Functions in programming are designed to operate on variables. They take input (variables), perform some operations, and return output. Understanding how variables work is crucial for effectively using functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll explore functions in more detail later ([Functions](#functions-and-functional-programming)), but for now, remember that functions are named blocks of code that manipulate variables to achieve specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some functions are built-in, meaning they are provided by the programming language itself, while others can be defined by the user. Built-in functions in Python include `print()` for displaying output, as well as `type()` for checking the type of a variable.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "It is both useful and pretty accurate to think of programmatic variables in the same way you think of algebraic variables in math. You can assign or change the value of a variable, and you can use it in calculations or operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a variable by assigning it a value using the equals sign (`=`). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you create a variable `x` that holds the value `5`, you can use it in calculations like this:\n",

    "| Float (`float`)        | Decimal numbers, e.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`, `2.0` |\n",
    "| String (`str`)        | Textual data, e.g., `\"Hello, world!\"`, `'Python'` |\n",
    "| List (`list`)         | Ordered collection of items, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, `['a', 'b', 'c']` |\n",

    "### For Loops\n",
    "A `for` loop iterates over a sequence (like a list or a string) and executes a block of code for each item in that sequence. Here's an example:\n",
